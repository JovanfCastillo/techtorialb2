# Given two strings, append them together (known as "concatenation") 
# and return the result. However, if the strings are different lengths, 
# omit chars from the longer string so it is the same length as the 
# shorter string. So "Hello" and "Hi" yield "loHi". 
# The strings may be any length.

print("enter string")
var=input()
print("enter string")

var2=input()

#IF they are same length I have to just do var +var2 
#If they are in different length i have to omit characters
#from longer string
